Elasticsearch Bundle was created in order to serve the need for
professional [Elasticsearch][1] integration with enterprise level Symfony
applications. This bundle is:

* Uses the official [elasticsearch-php][2] client.
* Ensures full integration with Symfony framework and Symfony Flex.

Technical goodies:

* Provides a DSL query builder which represent all ElasticSearch endpoints in the objective way.
* Provides interactive Document object generator via CLI command (`ongr:es:document:generate`)
* Creates a familiar Doctrine-like way to work with documents(entities) document-object mapping using annotations.
* Several query results iterators are provided for your convenience to work with results.
* Console CLI commands for the index management and data import/export/reindex.
* Profiler that integrates in the Symfony debug bar and shows all executed queries.
* Designed in an extensible way for all your custom needs.
* Supports Symfony FLEX.

## Documentation

The online documentation of the bundle can be found in [http://docs.ongr.io][4].
Docs source is stored within the repo under `Resources/doc/`, so if you see a typo or some inaccuracy, please submit a PR or at least an issue to fix it!

*For contribution to the documentation you can find it in the [contribute][5] topic.*

## Setup the bundle

#### Step 1: Install Elasticsearch bundle

Elasticsearch bundle is installed using [Composer][13].

```bash
php composer.phar require ongr/elasticsearch-bundle "~6.0"
```

> Instructions for installing and deploying Elasticsearch can be found in
 [Elasticsearch installation page][14].

Enable ElasticSearch bundle in your AppKernel:

```php
<?php
// config/bundles.php

return [
    // ...
    ONGR\ElasticsearchBundle\ONGRElasticsearchBundle::class => ['all' => true],
];

```

#### (OPTIONAL) Step 2: Add configuration 

Add minimal configuration for Elasticsearch bundle.

```yaml
# config/packages/ongr_elasticsearch.yaml
ongr_elasticsearch:
    source_directories: [/src/Document]
    analysis:
        filter:
            edge_ngram_filter: #-> your custom filter name to use in the analyzer below
                type: edge_ngram 
                min_gram: 1
                max_gram: 20
        analyzer:
            eNgramAnalyzer: #-> analyzer name to use in the document field
                type: custom
                tokenizer: standard
                filter:
                    - lowercase
                    - edge_ngram_filter #that's the filter defined earlier
    indexes:
        App\Document\Product:
            hosts: [elasticsearch:9200] # optional, the default is 127.0.0.1:9200
```

> This is the very basic example only, for more information, please take a look at the [configuration][9] chapter.

#### Step 3: Define your Elasticsearch types as `Document` objects

This bundle uses objects to represent Elasticsearch documents. Lets create the `Product` class for the `products` index.

```php
// src/Document/Product.php

namespace App\Document;

use ONGR\ElasticsearchBundle\Annotation as ES;

/**
 * //alias and default parameters in the annotation are optional. 
 * @ES\Index(alias="products", default=true)
 */
class Product
{
    /**
     * @ES\Id()
     */
    public $id;

    /**
     * @ES\Property(type="text", analyzer="eNgramAnalyzer")
     */
    public $title;

    /**
     * @ES\Property(type="float")
     */
    public $price;
}

```

> This is the basic example only, for more information about a mapping, please take a look
 at the [the mapping chapter][6].


#### Step 4: Create index and mappings

Elasticsearch bundle provides several `CLI` commands. One of them is for creating an index, run the command in your terminal:

```bash

bin/console ongr:es:index:create

```
Now the `products` index should be created with fields from your document.  

> More info about the rest of the commands can be found in the [commands chapter][8].


#### Step 5: Enjoy with the Elasticsearch

Full documentation for the Elasticsearch bundle is [available here][4].
I hope you will create amazing things with it :sunglasses: .

> Please note that the updating process of the documentation of the bundle to 6.0
>is still under way. Read the [configuration][7] and [crud][9] sections that are 
>already updated and will allow you to have the basic functions of the bundle. We
>will update the rest of the documentation as soon as possible
