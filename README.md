# ONGR Elasticsearch Bundle

Elasticsearch Bundle was created in order to serve the need for
professional [Elasticsearch][1] integration with enterprise level Symfony
applications. This bundle is:

* Supported by [ONGR.io][2] development team.
* Uses the official [elasticsearch-php][3] client.
* Ensures full integration with Symfony framework.

Technical goodies:

* Provides interactive Document object generator via CLI (`ongr:es:document:generate`)
* Provides DSL query builder to be executed by type repository services.
* Uses Doctrine-like documents(entities) document-object mapping using annotations.
* Query results iterators are provided for your convenience.
* Console CLI commands for index and types management and data import / export.
* Profiler that integrates in the Symfony debug bar and shows all executed queries.
* Designed in an extensible way for all your custom needs.

If you need any help, [stack overflow][4]
is the preferred and recommended way to ask questions about ONGR bundles and libraries.

## Setup the bundle

#### Step 1: Install Elasticsearch bundle

Elasticsearch bundle is installed using [Composer][16].

```bash
php composer.phar require ongr/elasticsearch-bundle "~5.0"

```

> Instructions for installing and deploying Elasticsearch can be found in
 [Elasticsearch installation page][17].

Enable Elasticsearch bundle in your AppKernel:

```php
// app/AppKernel.php

public function registerBundles()
{
    $bundles = [
        // ...
        new ONGR\ElasticsearchBundle\ONGRElasticsearchBundle(),
    ];
    
    // ...
}

```

#### Step 2: Add configuration

Add minimal configuration for Elasticsearch bundle.

```yaml

# app/config/config.yml

ongr_elasticsearch:
    managers:
        default:
            index:
                index_name: acme
            mappings:
                - AppBundle

```

> This is the very basic example only, for more information, please take a look at the [configuration][9] chapter.

In this particular example there are 2 things you should know. The index name in the index node and the mappings.
 Mappings is the place where your documents are stored (more info at [the mapping chapter][7]).


#### Step 3: Define your Elasticsearch types as `Document` objects

This bundle uses objects to represent Elasticsearch documents. Lets create a `Customer` class for customer document.

```php
// src/AppBundle/Document/Customer.php

namespace AppBundle\Document;

use ONGR\ElasticsearchBundle\Annotation as ES;

/**
 * @ES\Document()
 */
class Customer
{
    /**
     * @var string
     *
     * @ES\Id()
     */
    public $id;

    /**
     * @var string
     *
     * @ES\Property(name="name", type="string")
     */
    public $name;
}

```

> This is the basic example only, for more information about mapping, please take a look
 at the [the mapping chapter][7].


#### Step 4: Create index and mappings

Elasticsearch bundle provides several `CLI` commands. One of them is for creating index, run command in your terminal:

```bash

bin/console ongr:es:index:create

```

> More info about the rest of the commands can be found in the [commands chapter][10].


#### Step 5: Enjoy with the Elasticsearch

We advise to take a look at the [mapping chapter][7] to configure the index.
Search documentation for the Elasticsearch bundle is [available here][13].
And finally it's up to you what amazing things you are going to create :sunglasses: .
