Ongr Elasticsearch Bundle
=========================

professional `elasticsearch <http://www.elasticsearch.org>`_ integration with enterprise level Symfony
2 systems. This bundle is:

- Supported by `Ongr <http://ongr.io>`_ development team.

- Ensures full integration with Symfony 2 framework.

Technical goodies:

- Provides nestable and DSL query builder to be executed by type repository services.
- Uses Doctrine-like document / entities document-object mapping using annotations.
- Query results iterators are provided for your convenience.
- Registers console commands for index and types management and data import / export.
- Designed in an extensible way for all your custom needs.
