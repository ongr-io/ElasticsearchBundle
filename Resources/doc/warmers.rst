Warmers
=======

`Warmers`_ are used to run registered search requests to warm up the
index before it is available for search.

Registering a warmer
--------------------

Warmers should implement
``Ongr\ElasticsearchBundle\Cache\WarmerInterface`` and loaded as a
service with ``es.warmer`` tag. f.e.

.. code:: php

    class FooWarmer implements WarmerInterface
    {

        /**
         * {@inheritdoc}
         */
        public function warmUp(Search $search)
        {
            $search->addQuery(new MatchAllQuery());
        }

        /**
         * {@inheritdoc}
         */
        public function getName()
        {
            return 'test_foo_warmer';
        }
    }

Then register as a service (in this example yaml):

.. code:: yaml

    services:
        vendor_bundle.foo.warmer:
            class: Vendor\Bundle\Warmer\FooWarmer
            tags:
                - { name: es.warmer, manager: "default,bar" }

As you notice we can define multiple managers to load warmers to,
just be sure they are separated by commas and all surrounded by
quotations marks.

Putting warmers into index.
---------------------------

The easiet way to load warmers are through `commands <commands.html#warmer-put>`_.

Also we can load them manually. f.e.

.. code:: php

    $manager->getConnection()->putWarmers();
