# CHANGELOG
## v5.0.0 (2016-x)
- Drop PHP 5.5 support. Now only PHP >=5.6 are supported.
- Added support for Elasticsearch 5.0
- Array iterator now returns document _id field as well.
- Document annotation now has an options support.
You can pass any settings along parameters you want. Simply just put them in the options.
- Added `text` and `keyword` property types support.
- Added `char_filter` analysis support.
- All features and fixes from 1.2.x
- Added `document_dir`. From now on you can change documents directory for each mapped bundle.
- No more needed to define analysis in manager, it will be collected automatically from documents.

### Breaking changes
- Removed all deprecations from 1.x version.
- Service name `@annotations.cached_reader` changed to `@es.annotations.cached_reader` #717
- From Document annotation removed all properties except `type`. From now on everything has to be defined in the `options`.
- `string` property type was deprecated in elasticsearch 5.0, please use text or keyword accordingly.
 More info: https://www.elastic.co/blog/strings-are-dead-long-live-strings
- `auth` in the configuration was removed. Use authentication information directly in host or create event listener
 to modify client creation. There are too many ways to authenticate elasticsearch. That said we leaving this customisation to the user due difficult support. 
- `connections` node in configuration was removed. Use `index` from now on. There was absolute
 misunderstanding to have exposed connections, we never saw any benefits to use single connection
 between several managers.  
- `analysis` node in `index`/`connection` was deprecated. From now on used analyzers, filters and other
- `Results` (constants container for result type definitions) class was removed in favor for
 new find functions with predefined types in the names.
- Export service now uses own query calling instead of elasticsearch-php. It was changes due a bug
 in hits iterator in elasticsearch-php. We will try to help them to resolve this issue.
- `Manager::execute()` was removed. Use `Manager::search()` instead.
- `Manager::scroll()` third argument with result type definition was removed.
 Now you can get only raw result data from scroll.
- `AbstractElasticsearchTestCase::runTest()` was removed. It was introduced when elasticsearch
 in our CI was very unstable. Now there is no sense to repeat failing tests again and again.
- `AbstractElasticsearchTestCase::getNumberOfRetries()` was removed.
 If you write tests by extending `AbstractElasticsearchTestCase` delete your retries data provides.
